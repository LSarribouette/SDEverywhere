          <p>
            <strong>SDEverywhere</strong> is a collection of libraries and command line tools that help you improve the quality and expand
            the reach of a <a href="http://www.systemdynamics.org/what-is-s/">System Dynamics</a> model.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, SDEverywhere includes a toolchain to efficiently transform a model into C, JavaScript, and WebAssembly code.
            Additionally, SDEverywhere allows for unit testing, continuous integration, and the ability to compare model runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using SDEverywhere, you can deploy interactive System Dynamics models on mobile, desktop, and the web for policymakers
            and the public.
            Or you could perform model analysis using general-purpose languages, running the model as high-performance JavaScript or
            C code.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're looking for a relatively simple way to put a Vensim model on the web, SDEverywhere can help you there.
            SDEverywhere includes a build and configuration system that allows for defining graphs and sliders simply by
            editing text configuration files.
            SDEverywhere also includes project templates that &mdash; in a matter of minutes &mdash; can transform your Vensim
            model into a working web app that can be hosted on any server.
          </p>
          <p>

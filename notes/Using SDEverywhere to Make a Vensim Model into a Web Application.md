# Using SDEverywhere to Make a Vensim Model into a Web Application

This tutorial shows you how to take your Vensim model and turn it into an interactive web application using the open-source SDEverywhere toolkit. SDEverywhere currently requires the macOS operating system.

Following the "Installing" instructions on the SDEverywhere GitHub page to get started:

https://github.com/ToddFincannon/SDEverywhere

## Generating model code and validating it

Create a model directory.

Copy the model `.mdl` file into the model directory using a short, lower-case name, since you will be typing it in SDEverywhere commands. The placeholder for the model name (without the `.mdl` extension) in these instructions is `{model}`.

Run the model in Vensim using `{model}` as the run name.

Export the `.vdf` run in Vensim DAT format using Model > Export Dataset.

Generate C code, compile and run it, and validate the results against Vensim.
```
sde test {model}
```

SDEverywhere will list discrepancies between the Vensim run and data generated by the C model, up to a default precision of 1e-5. If you are getting errors and somewhat less precision, such as 1e-3, is acceptable, run the test with the `-p` option.

```
sde test -p 1e-3 {model}
```

## Designing your web app

SDEverywhere generates a web application based on a standard template. You fill in the template by creating an `app.yaml` file in [YAML](http://nodeca.github.io/js-yaml/) format. Use a plain text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) to create the file, starting from the `app-sample.yaml` file in the SDEverywhere `notes` directory. Refer to the *SDEverywhere Web App YAML Format Reference* document for details. There is a fully worked-out example in the `models/sir` directory. Place the `app.yaml` file in your model directory.
